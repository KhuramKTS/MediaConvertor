# MediaConvertor

This is a simple Python script that uses the ffmpeg library to convert a video file to any media format. The script prompts the user for the name of a video file and the path, and then uses the subprocess module to run the ffmpeg command to convert the file to any desired format. The output file is saved in the same directory as the input file, with the same name and a desired extension.

Usage:
Install ffmpeg on your system.
Clone or download the repository.
Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where the script is located.
Run the script by typing python MediaConvertor.py
Enter the name of a video file with path and press enter.
Enter format to which file is being converted.
Wait for the script to finish running. The output file will be saved in the same directory as the input file, with the same name and an extension.
